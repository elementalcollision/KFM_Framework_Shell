**Reviewing architecture document**

I need to conduct a thorough review of the architecture document, focusing on any underdeveloped areas and missing technical details. I'll critically evaluate the components to ensure we're following the best approach. An earlier summary helped, but I'll delve into specifics: for example, the Core Runtime is good but lacks hot-reload integration. I'll review areas like Iggy’s cluster maturity, Memory Service reliability, and security measures, including SOC2 or RBAC. Also, I'll look at API design, data governance, and observability improvements. Time to dive into those details\!

Thought for 34 seconds

## **Executive technical review & gap analysis**

Below is a critical, “red‑team” style review of the current **Agent Shell Architecture**. I focus on areas that look under‑specified or that could become integration or operational pain‑points, and suggest concrete next steps.

---

### **1. Apache Iggy as the backbone**

|  What’s strong  |  What’s missing / risky  |
| ----- | ----- |
| Clear mapping of streams, topics, partitions, consumer groups; basic retention policies are outlined.  | Replication and HA are deferred to “Iggy’s *developing* clustering features”. The doc rightly lists view‑stamped replication, but does not spell out **fail‑over topology, quorum size, or upgrade path**. Production readiness is unclear while Iggy is still incubating.  |
| JSON‑envelope pattern plus versioned payloads is solid for evolution.  | No **schema registry or compatibility testing** story. Without central schema governance, rolling upgrades risk breaking consumers. |
| Mentions dead‑letter queues in passing.  | DLQ creation, retention and replay workflows are not defined; neither is the alerting when the DLQ fills. |
| Talks about partition keys.  | No guidance on **hot‑partition detection & re‑sharding**, or cross‑partition ordering guarantees for multi‑step plans. |

**Recommendations**

* Prototype a **three‑node Iggy cluster** behind a load balancer and run chaos testing to verify partition leadership transfer.

* Add a **schema registry (even if custom JSON in S3/git)** with canary checks before producer deployment.

* Define DLQ topics per stream, document replay procedure in run‑books.

---

### **2. Core Runtime layer**

|  Strength  |  Gap  |
| ----- | ----- |
| Sub‑module responsibilities now clear.  | Concurrency disabled by default (`enable_parallel_step_execution = false`)  yet the scaling section assumes potential parallelism. Need a design for **step DAG scheduling**, lock‑free context updates, and idempotent side effects before turning this flag on. |
| Idempotency called out.  | Exactly **how duplicate suppression works across TurnManager ↔ PlanExecutor ↔ StepProcessor** is not described; ULID keys are mentioned but retrieval of “last processed step” after crash is unspecified. |
| Retry / circuit‑breaker patterns listed.  | No **end‑to‑end compensation logic**. E.g., if Step 3 writes memory then fails, who rolls the memory back? |
| Event traces well defined.  | Still missing **latency budgets** or SLOs for each stage; without them observability dashboards can’t flag regressions. |

---

### **3. Memory Service**

The design covers vector DB adapters and Redis cache, but several integration points are light:

* **Write consistency** – if pgvector is primary, how do we prevent stale reads when Step Processor writes embeddings and immediately queries them?

* **Backup / restore & GDPR delete** – the config shows TTLs  but does not specify snapshot cadence, PITR strategy, or per‑user purge flows.

* **High‑contention namespaces** – nothing on sharding or tenancy isolation when many personalities share the same pgvector cluster.

---

### **4. Provider Adapter layer**

* The abstraction is good, but we need **rate‑limit back‑pressure** from providers surfaced to the planner so it can choose cheaper/faster models automatically.

* Consider **connection pooling & reuse** for providers with HTTP/2 or gRPC to cut latency.

* “CostTracker” emits metrics, but no budget enforcement: how are hard ceilings per tenant enforced?

---

### **5. Personality Pack Manager & tool sandboxing**

* Hot‑reload controller is promising, yet executing arbitrary tool Python raises **supply‑chain & sandbox** risks. There is a note on vetting, but no technical guard‑rails (e.g., firejail, gVisor, or running tools in a dedicated micro‑VM).

* Version skew: if two turns of the same session straddle a personality hot‑reload, how is consistency maintained?

* Pack distribution format is filesystem; consider OCI‑image–like packaging to sign & scan packs before load.

---

### **6. API & Interface layer**

* Authentication is mentioned but **no concrete flow diagrams** (OAuth 2.1 / JWT introspection / API‑key rotation).

* WebSocket scaling options are listed; choose one and document session affinity or distributed pub‑sub for \>1 K pods.

* MCP/gRPC contracts are not enumerated; we need `.proto` definitions and explicit versioning strategy.

---

### **7. Observability**

* Metrics & tracing stack is solid; missing **sampling policy** (100 % traces of every step will be expensive).

* Need **dashboards & alert thresholds**: e.g., consumer‑lag \> 5 s, step failure ratio \> 2 %, Iggy broker disk \> 80 %.

* Log retention period and PII redaction pipeline are unspecified.

---

### **8. Security**

The section is comprehensive but still high‑level. Two areas deserve deeper integration work:

1. **Threat modelling & pen‑testing** – enumerate trust boundaries (tool code, personality prompts, provider responses).

2. **Secret rotation** – doc says use env‑vars; add a pattern for live key rotation without pod restart (e.g., HashiCorp Vault sidecar).

---

### **9. Testing & CI/CD**

* Contract tests are proposed, but pipeline stages (lint, type‑check, unit, integration with ephemeral Iggy, load test, security scan) are not laid out.

* Blue‑green or canary deploy strategy for Core Runtime not described; important because mis‑schema’d messages can wedge consumers.

---

### **10. Disaster‑Recovery & Compliance**

* RPO/RTO targets, backup of pgvector & Redis, Iggy log compaction snapshot, and restoration drill cadence are absent.

* No mention of **audit log immutability** or SOC 2 controls; if industry compliance matters, this is a gap.

---

## **Priority recommendations (next sprint)**

1. **Define and prototype Iggy clustering \+ schema registry** to de‑risk message‑bus choice.

2. **Design step‑level parallelism and state‑consistency contracts** (optimistic vs. pessimistic updates).

3. **Implement sandbox for personality tools** (initally Firecracker micro‑VM with network egress rules).

4. **Add CI job generating and linting Protobuf / OpenAPI specs** for every schema version.

5. **Write SLOs** (p95 latency, error budgets) and create Grafana dashboards \+ alerts.

6. **Draft data‑lifecycle policy** covering user‑requested deletion, backups, and legal hold.

Addressing these gaps early will prevent costly rewrites and outage risks later in the project lifecycle.
