## Decision Log: DEC-2025-05-13T14:50:00

**Date:** 2025-05-13T14:50:00

**Task(s) Related:** 
- `TASK-006: M5 – Observability & cost tracking` (Completed)
- `TASK-007: M6 – Beta launch (internal)` (Active)

**Decision Made:**
The project has successfully completed all prerequisite milestones (M1-M5) for the internal beta launch. The decision has been made to officially transition to TASK-007 (Beta Launch) based on the following factors:

1. TASK-006 (Observability & cost tracking) has been fully implemented and verified:
   - Structured JSON logging with trace ID propagation
   - Prometheus metrics for request latency, token usage, and costs
   - Cost tracking in all provider adapters
   - Exposed /metrics endpoint for Prometheus scraping

2. All required dependencies for TASK-007 have been satisfied:
   - TASK-003: Anthropic + Groq adapters ✓
   - TASK-004: Personality pack loader ✓
   - TASK-005: Memory service integration ✓
   - TASK-006: Observability & cost tracking ✓

**Next Steps:**
1. Begin comprehensive integration testing of all components to ensure stability
2. Prepare documentation for internal beta testers
3. Define scope and identify participants for the beta program
4. Set up feedback collection mechanism

**Rationale:**
The successful completion of TASK-006 marks a significant milestone for the project. With observability and cost tracking in place, we now have the necessary infrastructure to monitor and evaluate the system during beta testing. This transition aligns with the project timeline and puts us on track to meet the beta launch deadline of 2025-08-05.
