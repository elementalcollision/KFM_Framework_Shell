## Context
During implementation of the API-to-Runtime integration tests, we identified a mismatch between the API endpoints in `server.py` and the `TurnEventPayload` model. The endpoint was expecting certain fields that were required in the model, leading to potential validation errors.

## Decision
1. Make `instructions` and `parameters` fields optional in the `TurnEventPayload` model
2. Update the `/v1/turns` endpoint to correctly parse requests and populate the `TurnEventPayload` with specific fields
3. Implement comprehensive error handling in the API layer, including:
   - Malformed JSON handling (400 error)
   - Validation errors for missing required fields (422 error)
   - Internal server errors for unexpected exceptions (500 error)

## Rationale
- Making the fields optional provides more flexibility for various API clients
- Proper error handling improves debugging and client experience
- Comprehensive test coverage ensures all edge cases are handled correctly

## Implications
- API clients will have more flexibility in what fields they need to provide
- Error responses will be more consistent and informative
- The integration between API and Runtime components will be more robust

## Status
Implemented and verified through integration tests.

## Follow-up Actions
- Complete the remaining API integration test for handling unexpected exceptions during `event_publisher.publish`
- Document the API changes in the user guides for beta testers
