## Decision Log: DEC-2025-05-11T22:32:00

**Date:** 2025-05-11T22:32:00

**Task(s) Related:** `TASK-001: M0 â€“ Architecture sign-off`

**Decision Made:**
Further research and refinement of the architecture document (`.context/architecture/architecture_document.md`) are necessary before proceeding to a formal stakeholder review. This includes, but is not limited to:
1.  Completing the detailed specification of the Core Runtime Layer (achieved during this session).
2.  Addressing other identified gaps (e.g., message schemas, detailed error handling, security considerations).
3.  Performing minor cleanups in the document, such as removing redundant introductory text for the Core Runtime Layer.

**Rationale:**
To ensure the architecture document is as complete, clear, and robust as possible before presenting it for sign-off, maximizing the chances of a smooth review process and minimizing the need for extensive revisions post-review. The user explicitly stated "more research" as a key decision for the session.

**Alternatives Considered:**
-   Proceeding directly to stakeholder review with the document in its prior state (less detailed Core Runtime, other gaps not yet addressed).
    -   *Rejected because*: Could lead to a less productive review, more questions, and potentially significant rework.

**Impact:**
-   Postpones the immediate scheduling of the architecture review meeting.
-   Requires further focused work on the architecture document in subsequent sessions.

**Follow-up Actions:**
-   In the next session, continue to address identified gaps in the architecture document based on the review pass.
-   Perform the minor cleanup tasks related to the Core Runtime Layer section.
