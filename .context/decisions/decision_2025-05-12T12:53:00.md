## Decision Log: DEC-2025-05-12T12:53:00

**Date:** 2025-05-12T12:53:00

**Task(s) Related:** `TASK-001: M0 â€“ Architecture sign-off`

**Decision Made:**
The previously identified gaps in the architecture document have been addressed through focused refinement during this session. Specifically, the following sections were added or significantly enhanced:
1.  Data Flow and Message Schemas
2.  Error Handling Strategy
3.  Security Considerations
4.  Scalability Strategy
5.  ConfigLoader clarification (within Core Runtime Layer)
6.  Personality Pack tool execution details (within StepProcessor description)

**Rationale:**
To make the architecture document sufficiently detailed and comprehensive to proceed towards stakeholder review, as outlined in the objectives of `TASK-001`. Addressing these gaps ensures a clearer understanding of the system's design, interactions, and non-functional requirements.

**Alternatives Considered:**
-   Addressing fewer gaps per session: Rejected as the goal was to complete the planned refinements.
-   Postponing refinement: Rejected as it would delay progress on `TASK-001`.

**Impact:**
-   The architecture document is significantly more complete.
-   Progress on `TASK-001` has advanced substantially.
-   The document is now in a better state for internal review before stakeholder presentation.

**Follow-up Actions:**
-   Perform a full review of the updated `.context/architecture/architecture_document.md`.
-   Based on the review, schedule the architecture review meeting(s) with stakeholders (Step 2 of TASK-001).
-   Consider initiating `TASK-002: M1 - Core Runtime implementation` in parallel or subsequently.
