## Description
Finalize and obtain sign-off for the Agent Shell project architecture. This involves reviewing the proposed architecture against the PRD requirements and ensuring all stakeholders are aligned.

## Objectives
-   Present the proposed architecture to stakeholders.
-   Gather feedback and address concerns.
-   Obtain formal sign-off from the Engineering Lead and Product Owner.
-   Ensure architecture aligns with PRD goals (provider agnosticism, modularity, etc.).

## Steps
1.  Draft detailed architecture document.
2.  Schedule and conduct architecture review meeting(s).
3.  Incorporate feedback into the architecture document.
4.  Obtain written sign-off.
5.  Publish the final architecture document.

## Progress
**2025-05-10:**
- Initial draft of architecture document `.context/architecture/architecture_document.md` created and populated with high-level component descriptions.
- Key sections for Core Runtime, Provider Adapter, Personality Pack Manager, Memory Service, Iggy Integration, API Layer, and Observability Layer were outlined.

**2025-05-11:**
-   Significant refinement and expansion of the architecture document (`.context/architecture/architecture_document.md`).
-   Detailed specifications for the "Core Runtime Layer" were synthesized from provided documents and successfully inserted into the main architecture document. This included defining sub-modules, responsibilities, workflows, interactions, configuration examples, and scaling considerations.
-   Identified that minor cleanup of a redundant introductory paragraph for the Core Runtime and heading adjustment for the new section is pending.
-   Noted other areas for potential expansion in the document: Data Flow/Message Schemas, Error Handling, Security, Scalability details, ConfigLoader clarification, and Personality Pack tool execution.
-   Decision made to conduct further research and refinement before formal stakeholder review.

**2025-05-12:**
-   Architecture review meeting held.
-   Formal sign-off obtained from Engineering Lead and Product Owner.
-   Final architecture document published.
