# KFM Testing Environment - Phase 1 Implementation Log: Foundational Infrastructure Setup

## Objective
This document logs the progress and decisions for Phase 1 of implementing the KFM testing environment, focusing on foundational infrastructure. Key goals include setting up a local Kubernetes cluster with portability to DigitalOcean DOKS in mind, configuring GitHub Container Registry, creating a dedicated namespace, and ensuring Helm is ready.

## Date Started: 2025-05-14

## Key Decisions & Progress

### 1. Kubernetes Cluster Provisioning
*   **Decision (2025-05-14):** Start with a local Kubernetes cluster for initial setup and rapid iteration.
    *   **Chosen Local Environment:** Docker Desktop Kubernetes
    *   **Portability to DOKS:** All Kubernetes manifests and configurations will be designed to be as cloud-agnostic as possible, facilitating a smoother transition to DigitalOcean DOKS later. Avoid local-cluster-specific features where standard Kubernetes alternatives exist.
*   **Action Items:**
    *   [x] Install and configure the chosen local Kubernetes environment (Docker Desktop Kubernetes enabled).
    *   [x] Verify `kubectl` access to the local cluster (`docker-desktop` node is Ready).
    *   [x] Document basic cluster setup steps for reproducibility (Note: Setup involves enabling Kubernetes via standard Docker Desktop settings. Ensure Docker Desktop is allocated sufficient resources: e.g., 4+ CPUs, 8GB+ RAM, and adequate disk space for images and volumes).

### 2. Container Registry Setup
*   **Decision (2025-05-14):** Utilize GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) as specified in `infrastructure_testing_environment_specs.md`.
*   **Prerequisites (Added 2025-05-14):**
    *   [ ] Initialize a local Git repository for the KFM_Framework_Enablers project (if not already done).
    *   [ ] Create a new repository on GitHub for this project.
    *   [ ] Push the local project to the GitHub repository.
*   **Action Items:**
    *   [ ] Once the project is on GitHub, verify GHCR (GitHub Packages) is enabled for the project repository (usually enabled by default for public repos, may need explicit enabling for private repos or organization settings).
    *   [ ] Confirm necessary permissions (e.g., `write:packages`) are in place for pushing images. This might involve setting repository-level package permissions or configuring GitHub Actions workflow permissions.
    *   [ ] Document the process for logging into GHCR for Docker CLI (`docker login ghcr.io -u <USERNAME> -p <PAT>`).

### 3. Kubernetes Namespace Creation
*   **Decision (2025-05-14):** Create a dedicated namespace `kfm-testing` for all resources related to this environment.
*   **Action Items:**
    *   [ ] Create the `kfm-testing` namespace in the local Kubernetes cluster (`kubectl create namespace kfm-testing`).
    *   [ ] Configure `kubectl` context to use this namespace by default for this project or ensure all subsequent `kubectl` commands specify `-n kfm-testing`.

### 4. Helm Installation/Verification
*   **Decision (2025-05-14):** Use Helm for deploying third-party components where official charts are available.
*   **Action Items:**
    *   [ ] Verify Helm v3+ is installed locally.
    *   [ ] If not installed, install Helm.
    *   [ ] Add commonly used Helm chart repositories if needed (e.g., `stable`, `bitnami`, specific vendor repos).

## Notes & Challenges
*   (Log any issues encountered, solutions, or specific configurations made during this phase)

## Next Steps (Post Phase 1 Completion)
*   Proceed to Phase 2: Core Dependencies Deployment.
